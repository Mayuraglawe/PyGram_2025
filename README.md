## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PNPM (recommended) or npm
- Supabase account (optional, uses mock data by default)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mayuraglawe/PyGram_2025.git
   cd PyGram_2025
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   
   Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## 📊 Database Schema

The system uses a normalized PostgreSQL schema with the following entities:

- **Faculty**: Teachers and instructors
- **Subjects**: Academic courses with credit and lab requirements
- **Classrooms**: Physical spaces with capacity and equipment specs
- **Student Batches**: Class groups with enrollment data
- **Time Slots**: Scheduled periods throughout the week
- **Timetables**: Generated schedules with quality metrics
- **Scheduled Classes**: Individual class assignments

### Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the schema migration:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste from database/schema.sql
   ```
3. Optionally add sample data:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste from database/sample-data.sql
   ```

## 🎯 Key Components

### Timetable Generation
- **Algorithm**: Two-phase approach combining constraint satisfaction with genetic optimization
- **Constraints**: Hard constraints (conflicts) and soft constraints (preferences)
- **Quality Metrics**: Automated scoring based on various optimization criteria

### Conflict Detection
```typescript
// Real-time conflict detection
const conflicts = findConflicts(scheduledClasses);
// Highlights conflicts across faculty, batches, and classrooms
```

### State Management
```typescript
// RTK Query for API operations
const { data: faculty } = useGetFacultyQuery();
const [addFaculty] = useAddFacultyMutation();
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev        # Start dev server
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm start      # Start production server
```

### Production Options

#### Netlify (Recommended)
- Automatic deployment from GitHub
- Serverless functions for API
- Pre-configured in `netlify.toml`

#### Manual Deployment
```bash
pnpm build
# Deploy dist/spa to your static hosting
# Deploy server build for API functionality
```
