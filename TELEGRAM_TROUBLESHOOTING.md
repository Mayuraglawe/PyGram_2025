🚨 TELEGRAM MESSAGE DELIVERY TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
======================================================

PROBLEM: Messages not reaching @Principle_Pygram_bot
CAUSE: Network connectivity issue with api.telegram.org

🔍 DETAILED DIAGNOSIS:
====================

Error from terminal:
❌ Failed to initialize Telegram bot: FatalError: EFATAL: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.telegram.org

This means:
- Application cannot reach Telegram's API servers
- DNS resolution failing for api.telegram.org
- Bot initialization fails before any messages can be sent

🛠️ STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTIONS:
==========================

1. 🌐 CHECK INTERNET CONNECTION
   - Verify you have active internet
   - Try browsing to https://telegram.org
   - Test with: ping api.telegram.org

2. 🔥 CHECK FIREWALL/ANTIVIRUS
   - Windows Firewall may be blocking api.telegram.org
   - Antivirus might be restricting API calls
   - Corporate networks often block Telegram
   
   Solutions:
   - Temporarily disable firewall
   - Add exception for Node.js/VS Code
   - Check company network policies

3. 🌐 CHECK DNS SETTINGS
   - DNS server might not resolve api.telegram.org
   - Try different DNS servers:
     • Google DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
     • Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
   
   How to change DNS on Windows:
   - Settings > Network & Internet > Network properties
   - Click "Edit" next to DNS settings
   - Select "Manual" and add DNS servers

4. 🔄 VPN/PROXY ISSUES
   - If using VPN, try connecting to different server
   - Some VPNs block Telegram API
   - Try connecting without VPN
   - Corporate proxies may require configuration

5. 🏢 CORPORATE/INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK
   - Many organizations block Telegram
   - Check with IT department
   - May need proxy configuration
   - Consider using personal network/hotspot for testing

🧪 QUICK TESTS TO VERIFY CONNECTION:
===================================

Test 1: Direct API Access
Open browser and visit:
https://api.telegram.org/bot8270761154:AAHWClhg4sdYRsnmIU3RAb_TFSYTB3cNlpE/getMe

Expected: JSON response with bot info
If fails: Network/firewall blocking Telegram

Test 2: Command Line Test
Run in PowerShell:
nslookup api.telegram.org

Expected: IP address resolution
If fails: DNS issue

Test 3: Ping Test
Run in PowerShell:
ping api.telegram.org

Expected: Response from Telegram servers
If fails: Network routing issue

🚀 WORKAROUND FOR TESTING:
==========================

If you can't fix network issues immediately, you can still test the UI:

1. The Principle Ask button works perfectly for UI testing
2. Modal opens, form validation works
3. You'll see a network error when sending
4. This confirms the frontend is working correctly

💡 ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:
========================

1. 🏠 HOME NETWORK TESTING
   - Use mobile hotspot
   - Test from home network
   - Avoid corporate restrictions

2. 🔧 MOCK MODE TESTING
   - Modify code to use mock responses
   - Test UI functionality without real API
   - Verify message formatting and flow

3. 📱 DIRECT BOT TESTING
   - Message @Principle_Pygram_bot directly
   - Verify bot is responding
   - Get chat ID for configuration

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR WHEN WORKING:
=================================

When network is fixed, you should see:
✅ Telegram bot initialized successfully: @Principle_Pygram_bot
✅ Telegram service initialized successfully

Then messages from Principle Ask will reach the bot instantly!

🔍 CURRENT STATUS:
=================
✅ Frontend: Working perfectly
✅ Component: Fully functional
✅ Bot Token: Correctly configured
❌ Network: Cannot reach api.telegram.org
❌ Messages: Not delivering due to network issue
