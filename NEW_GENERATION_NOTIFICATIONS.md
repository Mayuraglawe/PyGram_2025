# New Generation Feature - Notification System

## ✅ **YES! Notifications Are Now Sent**

When creators fill out exam or assignment forms, **notifications are automatically sent to both students and publishers** in the department.

## How It Works

### 📧 **When Creator Submits Exam Information:**
1. **Form Submission**: Creator fills out exam details (type, subject, date, time, etc.)
2. **Data Saved**: Information is saved to `exam_information` table
3. **Notifications Sent**: Automatic notifications go to:
   - **All Students** in the department
   - **All Publishers** in the department
4. **Confirmation**: Creator sees success message confirming notifications were sent

### 📋 **When Creator Submits Assignment Information:**
1. **Form Submission**: Creator fills out assignment details (title, subject, due date, etc.)
2. **Data Saved**: Information is saved to `assignment_information` table
3. **Notifications Sent**: Automatic notifications go to:
   - **All Students** in the department
   - **All Publishers** in the department
4. **Confirmation**: Creator sees success message confirming notifications were sent
